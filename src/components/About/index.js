        I recently graduated the certificate program from UWM Extended Campus. This was a full stack bootcamp utilizing the MERN stack. Immediately after graduation I started and completed a 60 hour react certificate course. I am currently enrolled in another course because, lets face it learning in web development never ends! I am trying to find my first career into web development which is proving to be as hard or even harder then the bootcamp itself(I know hard to believe..right?!)
